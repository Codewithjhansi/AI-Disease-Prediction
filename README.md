# AI-Disease-Prediction
Developed a CNN-based deep learning model to detect brain tumors from MRI images. Built using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras during my AI internship. The model classifies images into tumor and non-tumor with high accuracy, aiming to support early medical diagnosis.

# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using CNN

This project uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to detect brain tumors from MRI images.

## 📌 Project Overview

- 💻 **Language:** Python  
- 🧠 **Frameworks:** TensorFlow, Keras  
- 🧪 **Type:** Major Project (AI Internship)  
- 🧬 **Goal:** Classify MRI brain scans into Tumor or No Tumor  
- 📊 **Output:** Predicts presence of tumor with high accuracy

## 🛠️ Features

- MRI image pre-processing
- CNN model creation and training
- Model evaluation and accuracy checking
- GUI-friendly Jupyter Notebook

## 🔍 Dataset

The dataset contains labeled MRI brain images (tumor / non-tumor). Public dataset used during internship.

## 🎯 Results

- Achieved good accuracy on test data
- Effective at detecting tumor presence
- Supports early diagnosis with automation

## 🚀 Future Scope

- Extend to multi-class tumor types
- Deploy as a web/Android application
- Add explainable AI (XAI) for doctors
